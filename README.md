## Challenge #9: CSS Zen Garden
Visit http://www.csszengarden.com/ and explore some of the designs.

You will create your own version of the CSS Zen Garden.

Download the HTML and CSS files.
📎 HTML
📎 CSS

Copy the contents of the HTML file into your ```index.html```.
Copy the contents of the CSS file into your ```styles.css```.

The only rule: you may only change the CSS; not the HTML.

✏️ In an effort to keep this project like the Zen Garden website, this exercise does not have a styles folder.

Proud of your work? Sumbit it to the Zen Garden website.
